output â€“ The first column consists of the matrix profile
        the second column consists of the matrix profile indices
        the third column consists of the left matrix profile indices
        the fourth column consists of the right matrix profile indices.

        * matrix profile represents the distances between
        all subsequences within a time series and their nearest neighbor

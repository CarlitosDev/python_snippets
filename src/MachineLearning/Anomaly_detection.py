- outlier detector: compares whether in-streaming data is an inlier or outlier against pre-calculated thresholds
 and an outage detector. The small remainder of metrics classified as outliers are subsequently analyzed by the outage detector.
 -outage detector. The outage detector is computationally more complex and thus cannot be applied to all metrics with high frequency. Multivariate non-linear approach.


 Let the past be the past. 
 Past outages and outliers must not affect the outlier score for in-streaming data points. For example, during a thunderstorm in Chicago in June 2015 (see above image), ride demand increased 300%. That next week, we didnâ€™t want our outlier algorithm to adapt to it. We utilize a median approach to allow for statistical robustness.

'''

Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. 
Each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.

Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (which matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment) 


'''

cd /Users/carlos.aguilar/Documents/EF_repos

mkdir superset-virtualenv && cd superset-virtualenv

python3 -m venv env
# It will not include any of your existing site packages.
'''
Hereâ€™s what each folder contains:

	bin: files that interact with the virtual environment
	include: C headers that compile the Python packages
	lib: a copy of the Python version along with a site-packages folder where each dependency is installed

'''


# Activate the environment
$ source env/bin/activate

# (deactivate simply 'deactivate')



############
# Example: Install Apache Superset in a virtual environment
############

# (1) Shell commmands
mkdir superset-virtualenv && cd superset-virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate


# (2) Shell+PIP commands 
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip

# Some more stuff for my connections
pip install psycopg2
pip install pymssql


# Install superset
pip install superset



# >> Workaround for the pandas issue as of 1st July 2019
'''

Replace the two occurrences of _maybe_box_datetimelike 
with maybe_box_datetimelike in superset/dataframe.py directly in the installed package. 
It's a workaround of course but apparently it works

In here:
cd ./env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/superset/dataframe.py


It will work with pandas 0.24

This example is from the book: 
https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/bayesian-methods-for/9780133902914/ch01.html

There are two versions:

PyMC3 (elegant and close to the formulation of the problem)
https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Ch1_Introduction_PyMC3.ipynb


and Tensorflow probability - much more obscure in my opinion
